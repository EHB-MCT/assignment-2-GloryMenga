# Project Progress: Melody Generator

## Introduction

This project involves building a web application that allows users to generate melodies based on prompts, share them publicly or privately, and track user engagement through metrics such as time spent on the site, prompt keywords, and sharing behavior. The goal was to gain experience in full-stack development and data tracking using MongoDB, React, and Express.

## Project Completion Status

### Completed Features

- **Frontend**

  - Implemented full navigation system (`Nav.jsx`).
  - **Generate Page**: Users can submit prompts to generate melodies.
  - **Community Page**: Users can view publicly posted melodies, like, comment, and share them.
  - **Dashboard Page**: Displays user engagement insights through visual analytics.

- **Backend**

  - Fully functional server setup with Express.
  - Connected MongoDB for persistent data storage.
  - Implemented various API endpoints for:
    - Tracking time spent by users.
    - Storing prompt keywords.
    - Monitoring the number of shares and public/private sharing data.
    - Calculating and tracking conversion rates.

- **Database**

  - Created `Data-development` database with the following collections:
    - **`time`**: Tracks session durations.
    - **`prompts`**: Stores user-generated prompts and extracted keywords.
    - **`shares`**: Monitors user sharing behavior.
    - **`posts`**: Distinguishes between public and private posts.
    - **`sessions`**: Tracks visitor sessions and conversion rates.
  - Set up TTL indexes to automatically delete data older than 30 days.

- **Visual Data Representation**
  - Designed **interactive dashboards** for user engagement insights.
  - Created the following **visualizations**:
    - **Average Time Spent on the Website**.
    - **Most Frequently Used Prompt Keywords (Word Cloud)**.
    - **Percentage of Shared vs. Not Shared Melodies (Pie Chart)**.
    - **Public vs. Private Posts (Bar Chart)**.
    - **Conversion Rate Over Time (Line Chart)**.
  - Incorporated **Chart.js** and **react-wordcloud** for data visualization.
