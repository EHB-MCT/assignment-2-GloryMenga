# üéµ Melody Generator - Data Aggregation Project

Welcome to the **Melody Generator** project! This is a mock project designed as part of an assignment to demonstrate **data aggregation** techniques using a web application. While the site simulates functionality, it does **not actually generate melodies**. Instead, its primary purpose is to track and collect user interaction data on the website for analytical purposes.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

The **Melody Generator** allows users to:

- Write a **prompt** and simulate the generation of a melody.
- Share the generated melody using a "Share" button.
- Choose to post the melody **publicly** or save it **privately**.

The data collected from user interactions is stored in a MongoDB database. The focus of this project is on tracking user behavior rather than creating functional melody generation features.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The project was built to:

1. **Track and aggregate user interaction data**, including:
   - Time spent on the site.
   - Prompts entered by users.
   - Number of shares.
   - Public vs. private post counts.
   - Conversion rates of users who interact with the melody generation feature.
2. **Store aggregated data** in a MongoDB collection for analysis.
3. Demonstrate how frontend and backend systems can be used to track and handle user data efficiently.

## üö® Disclaimer

This project is **not a fully functional melody generator**. It was created solely for learning and demonstration purposes. All features related to melody generation are simulated, and the primary focus is on **data aggregation** and **backend integration**.

---

## üí° Features

1. **Frontend**:

   - Users can:
     - Input a melody prompt.
     - Simulate generating a melody and see placeholder results (e.g., an audio player).
     - Share the simulated melody and choose to post it publicly or privately.

2. **Backend**:

   - The backend tracks user interactions and saves the following data in a MongoDB database:
     - **Session Duration**: The time each user spends on the website.
     - **Prompt Keywords**: The prompts entered by users.
     - **Shares**: The number of times users click the "Share" button.
     - **Public vs. Private Posts**: Whether users post melodies publicly or save them privately.

3. **Database**:
   - The project uses MongoDB as the database.
   - Collected data is stored in the `Data` collection under the `Data-development` database.
   - A TTL index is implemented to automatically delete data older than 30 days.

## üìä Data Visualization

### How is the Data Visualized?

Collected data is visualized using Chart.js and displayed on a Dashboard.

- Time Spent on Site: Line chart showing average time per session.
- Prompt Keywords: Word cloud highlighting the most frequently used words in user prompts.
- Share Analytics: Pie chart displaying shared vs. unshared melodies.
- Public vs. Private Posts: Bar chart comparing public vs. private posts.
- Conversion Rates: Line graph tracking daily conversion trends.Conversion Rates: Line graph tracking daily conversion trends.

## üóÉÔ∏è How Data Aggregation Works

The project uses MongoDB to store and manage user interactions.

1. **Time Spent on the Site**

Tracking user engagement based on session duration.

Schema:

```bash
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "timeSpent": "number",
  "visitDate": "Date"
}
```

Insights:

- Helps determine if users are spending enough time engaging with the website.
- Used to improve content or layout to retain users longer.
- A TTL index automatically deletes records older than 30 days to optimize storage.

2. **Prompt Keywords**

Analyzing the type of prompts users input.

Schema:

```bash
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "prompt": "string",
  "keywords": ["string"],
  "timestamp": "Date"
}
```

Insights:

- Keywords help filter and categorize content in the community section.
- Frequently used words guide content recommendations.
- Data is deleted after 30 days to prevent saturation.

3. **Number of Shares**

Tracking how often users share their melodies.

Schema:

```bash
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "shared": "boolean",
  "timestamp": "Date"
}
```

Insights:

- Determines whether users find the content share-worthy.
- Helps assess the need for additional social sharing integrations.
- Non-shared entries are also logged to identify barriers to sharing.

4. **Public vs. Private Posts**

Analyzing how many users choose to post publicly or privately.

Schema:

```bash
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "publicPost": "boolean",
  "privatePost": "boolean",
  "timestamp": "Date"
}
```

Insights:

- Determines the relevance of the community page.
- If private posts dominate, the public page may need improvement.
- Data is stored with a TTL index to maintain efficiency.

5. **Conversion Rates**

Measuring how many users generate a melody after visiting the site.

Schema:

```bash
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "converted": "boolean",
  "timestamp": "Date"
}
```

Insights:

- Helps track the effectiveness of the melody generation feature.
- Conversion trends can be used to refine UX and UI.
